Knowing that one team uses 16 liters of E85 for the whole event (practice included). You decide to make it in the Balkan way, so how many kg of fruits you must collect in order to obtain the required amount of E85 fuel, knowing that from 25kg of fruits (plums, bananas, apricots, etc.) you get around of 8 liters of pure ethanol. You will also have to find how many barrels of 50kg do you need to deposit the fruits.",

The others are either bad practice or wrong measures even if the failure scenario is correct. \\n\nThe watchdog is a timer with a period equal to the fastest tasks cycle time plus its estimated maximum execution time. The timer is usually reset at the end of the fastest task execution.\\n\nIf the reset doesn’t happen, the ISR of the timer is triggered which results in a watchdog timeout.\\n\nAs the motor control task is the most critical one (shortest cycle time and highest priority, except for watchdog), the watchdog reset is done here. If the watchdog reset is implemented correctly, a timeout can only occur, if something interrupts the motor control task.\\n\nConsequently, only an ISR is capable of blocking the watchdog reset and cause a timeout. Another possible scenario would be, if the execution of the motor control task is taking too long. However none of the provided tips is pointing in this direction. The capture/compare timer input (for pump speed evaluation) is usually connected to an ISR. Common or good practice for such an application is to evaluate the PWM signal inside the ISR, save the value (e.g. duty cycle) to a global variable and process it outside of the ISR.\\n\nEven the calculation of a flow rate inside the ISR would not take too much computation time but maybe require additional data from other software modules (e.g. information about the cooling ciruit) which may result in less data encapsulation and therefore is considered bad practice.\\n\nA display update is usually done via sendig signals on a bus (like UART, I2C or SPI) to the display. Depending on the display, its resolution and other parameters, this can take quite a lot of messages to transfer all the information to the display. Furthermore, parameters like the bus speed or timing requirements may further increase the needed time.\\n\nIf all these actions are done in the ISR, this may block the motor control task from execution too long to reset the watchdog timer before the timeout happens.",

As a formula student team member, you want to invest minimal effort into passing the scrutineering. You decide to score the effort put into the design, so you are better able to minimize the time spent on the task. Scoring for design actions goes as follows:\\nBase score (no extra action necessary) = 0 points\\nDesigning one sufficient PCB cutout under the component = 1 point\\nCorrectly applying conformal coating on the PCB = 2 points\\nWhat is the minimal point value of the effort you put in so that you still comply with the current (2025 v1.1) FSG rules? The score of the effort is the sum of the required actions.\\nAssume PCB has no other components, a clear straight isolation barrier, and only one (this) component going over it. Your TS battery pack consists of Sony VTC5a 18650 cells in 74S10P configuration. Digital isolator in DIP-8 THT package does have sufficient temperature and voltage datasheet ratings.",

After passing the scrutineering, including DV scrutineering, they find a critical fault in their DV system, preventing them from competing in any DV event. Team X therefore decides to compete only in drivered events. Just before the endurance, they remove all the driverless mechanisms from the vehicle, including power steering and EBS, saving 7 kg in total. At the post inspection after successfully finishing the endurance, they are confronted by the scrutineer about the weight discrepancy. The team's argument is that both power steering and EBS are useless and not powered during endurance anyway, so there is no reason to have them in the vehicle.\\n\\nWhat will be the punishment for Team X?",
