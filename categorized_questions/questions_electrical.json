    "text": "Your head of powertrain has found a battery cell with excellent specifications and yet cheap. He decides upon a 142s2p accumulator configuration using the cells with a capacity of 5.8 Ah. The manufacturer specifies an internal impedance of 1.5 mOhm. However, after a while you notice the cells are horrible quality and their real capacity caries significantly leading to an unbalanced accumulator.\nHe performed experiments to find an approximation of the cells SoC relation to their open-circuit volage (EMF) as shown in the following figure:\nAssume due to imbalance, exactly half of the accumulators cells are at 40% SoC and half at 80% SoC. What current will be drawn at the maximum allowed power usage? (answer in A)\nRound the voltage in the figure and the answer to the nearest decimal (e.g. 3.15V becomes 3.2V and 1.15 A becomes 1.2 A)\nPlease use the following format: 12.3 or 1.23 (no ',' comma, no latters), round to 3 significant digits.",

This accumulator is used to drive an Endurance that takes 1440s. The car re-generated energy during 18% of the lap time with an average total accumulator charging current of 3A. 9% of the lap time the accumulator was not charged or discharged. Energy was sourced to the motors for the rest of the lap time with an average discharge current of 30A. How much energy is wasted during Endurance due to the internal resistance of the cells? NOTE: No other losses have to be taken into account. Wherever possible, average values may be used and simplifications may be applied. For example the influence of the internal cell resistance on the accumulator voltage should be neglected.",

    "text": " To validate your aerodynamic package you perform straight runs with constant velocity on horizontal surface (no inclination) and log the measured values of your linear potentiometers mounted on your suspension in parallel with the springs and dampers. Both the sensors and the springs have linear characteristics in the measurement domain (F [N] spring force ~ Δs [m] spring ~ U [V] measured voltage).\\n First, you measure the mass of the car without the driver. On the front axle you measure the total mass of 81.8 [kg] (sum of left and right sides) and on the rear axle 88.3 [kg] (left and right side together). Meanwhile the average of the measured voltages of the two linear potentiometers on the front axle is 2.36 [V] and on the rear axle is 2.45 [V].\\n Then you also measure the mass of the car with the driver inside. The results are the following: 120.7 [kg] and 3.33 [V] on the front axle and 121.2 [kg] and 3.25 [V] on the rear axle. \\n Then your driver performs the constant velocity runs with the car. Based on the logs with the appropriate data filtering you calculate that the velocity was 60.48 [km/h] and on the front axle the average measured voltage was 4.26 [V], while on the rear it was 4.23 [V].\\n During the test you also operated a mobile mini weather station. From this you know that the ambient pressure was 103 [kPa] and the air temperature was 26.3 [°C]. The humidity was low; thus you can use 0.02896 [kg/mol] as the molecular mass of the air. Wind speed was 0.\\n The frontal surface of your vehicle is A = 1.14 [m^2]. Use g = 9.81 [m/s^2] as the constant for gravity.\\n Calculate your vehicle’s lift (downforce) coefficient from the results of the tesƟng! Calculate the position of the CoG and the CoP (relative to the wheelbase) at the velocity measured during the run!\\n Where is the CoP relative to the CoG?\\n From the options below select one cl [-] value and one CoG-CoP relationship option!",
