Cell energy in this case is calculated according to the Formula Student Rules 2022. The previous configuration was 140s3p and the new one is 144s2p. The nominal and maximum cell voltage has not changed, they are 3.7 V and 4.2 V respectively in both cases. The total mass of the cells in the previous configuration was 42 kg. The total energy stored in the new battery is 6220.8 Wh. What is the nominal capacity of the previous cell?",
