For the gravitational acceleration, assume the value that can be measured at the Hungaroring (ca. Budapest) rounded to 2 decimals. On the day of driving, George sees that the temperatures reach room temperature values according to ISO 13443 natural gas reference conditions. As he steps on the scale to measure his own weight, he also sees, that the poppy seed rolls from Christmas are still measurable in his belly and he still weighs 15 kg. At least how much speed does he need to maintain while driving on the ceiling when the stated circumstances occur? Assume just the main forces acting on George and his vehicle (a point mass may be equivalent) in an equilibrium state to determine the minimum needed speed in a moment of bottom-up driving.
