    "text": " To validate your aerodynamic package you perform straight runs with constant velocity on horizontal surface (no inclination) and log the measured values of your linear potentiometers mounted on your suspension in parallel with the springs and dampers. Both the sensors and the springs have linear characteristics in the measurement domain (F [N] spring force ~ Δs [m] spring ~ U [V] measured voltage).\\n First, you measure the mass of the car without the driver. On the front axle you measure the total mass of 81.8 [kg] (sum of left and right sides) and on the rear axle 88.3 [kg] (left and right side together). Meanwhile the average of the measured voltages of the two linear potentiometers on the front axle is 2.36 [V] and on the rear axle is 2.45 [V].\\n Then you also measure the mass of the car with the driver inside. The results are the following: 120.7 [kg] and 3.33 [V] on the front axle and 121.2 [kg] and 3.25 [V] on the rear axle. \\n Then your driver performs the constant velocity runs with the car. Based on the logs with the appropriate data filtering you calculate that the velocity was 60.48 [km/h] and on the front axle the average measured voltage was 4.26 [V], while on the rear it was 4.23 [V].\\n During the test you also operated a mobile mini weather station. From this you know that the ambient pressure was 103 [kPa] and the air temperature was 26.3 [°C]. The humidity was low; thus you can use 0.02896 [kg/mol] as the molecular mass of the air. Wind speed was 0.\\n The frontal surface of your vehicle is A = 1.14 [m^2]. Use g = 9.81 [m/s^2] as the constant for gravity.\\n Calculate your vehicle’s lift (downforce) coefficient from the results of the tesƟng! Calculate the position of the CoG and the CoP (relative to the wheelbase) at the velocity measured during the run!\\n Where is the CoP relative to the CoG?\\n From the options below select one cl [-] value and one CoG-CoP relationship option!",
