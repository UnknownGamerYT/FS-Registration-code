    "text": "Dimension a bolt-like part named “DESIGN PART” (required dimensions are D1, D2 and L) which is a part of the assembly provided in drawing “tolerance_stackup_analysis_drawing.pdf”. \\n Requirements for the part are:\\n must protrude a minimum of 7 mm from an assembly \\n must have minimum clearance possible to the holes through which it passes (it must not be interference fit) \\n contact area of the head to surface D needs to be minimum of 130 mm2\\n all of the requirements above need to be satisfied in worst case scenario of 1D tolerance stackup for each axis\\n NOTE: for dimensioning use worst-case scenario criteria of 1D tolerance stackup analysis. Do a 1D tolerance stackup analysis for each axis separately and then consider the worst case of those for each dimension.\\n Round all dimensions to 3 decimal points (e.g.,0,123). Write the dimensions and separate them by a semicolon (X,XXX; Y,YYY; Z,ZZZ)",
