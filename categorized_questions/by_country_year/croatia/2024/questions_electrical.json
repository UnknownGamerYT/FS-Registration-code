The machine’s total losses can be determined as follows: (see below)\\nP(Cu) represents the copper losses in the system. How much copper losses will occur assuming these specs?\\nP(rated) = 50kW\\nI(rated) = 7200mA\\nU(rated) = reffer to FSG's maximum permitted voltage\\nR(s) = 0,0001 kOhm\\nR(Eddy) = 50000 uOhm\\nNote: Enter your result with two decimal digits.",

Battery cells are closely packed without separation into module. You want to have maximum power without overheating the battery and motor and maximum efficiency.\\nAssumption:\\n- Battery cells are closely packed without separation into modules.\\n- Commutation is resolved and has no losses.\\n- Although it is not the same depending on the configuration, positive and negative busses of the battery and the wires connecting to the motor are assumed to have irrelevant losses for simplicity.\\n- Battery and motor operating voltage will match.\\n- Inductance.\\n\\nWhile ignoring battery main positive and negative buses and short wire from buses to the motor windings, do you go for:",
