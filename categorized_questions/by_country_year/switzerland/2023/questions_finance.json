    "text": "During last year acceleration a top speed of 100 km/h was reached. Due to big impreovement in the new drivetrain, the new vehicle reaches a top speed of 120 km/h. The aerodynamics chief has some worries about the stability of the rear wing bracing due of the highr aerodynamics load. Given the geometry below, by how much % does the bearing force in point A change in comparison to last year (The aerodynamic package did not change and therefore some values can be assumed for both vehicles). All the useful parameters are given below:\ncL=3.8, cD=1.2, A=1m², p=1.1kg/m³, L1=50mm, L2=100mm, H1=125mm, H2=165mm\nPlease use the following format: 12.3 or 1.23 (no ',' comma, no latters), round to 3 significant digits.",
