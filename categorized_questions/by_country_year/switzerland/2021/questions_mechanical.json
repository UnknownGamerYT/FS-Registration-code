The force F actiong on the bracket is parallel to the chassis and acts at a distance h over the bottom of the bracket. The bolt is made from aluminium with T(Al,max) = 150 MPa and p(Al,max) = 150 Mpa.\\n The diameters of the bolt should be an integer expressed in mm (e.g. 4mm, 5mm, 6mm and so on). Dermine the minimal allowable diameter of the boit assuming a SF of 1.4. You can assume, that there is no friction and the bracket, as well as the chassis are infinitely stiff(i.e. no Bending on the bolt will occur). Furthermore, you can use a simplified formula for the shear stresses. (answer in mm)",
