    "text": "Your team just participated in the auto-cross event, you are now preparing the car for the endurance event and your Chief Aero Engineer remarks that you have much more grip then expected and take a lot of pitch, hence losing downforce. He asks you (Suspension Engineer) to increase the pitch stiffness of the car. Unfortunately, you can only change the spring of each axle and the Performance Engineer wants you to keep the same stiffness balance in order to keep the drivers happy. Taking into account tyre stiffness, what spring do you choose for the front and rear axle to keep the same balance of stiffness (kAxleF/(kAxleF kAxleR)) rounded to 0.1%?\\n- Car mass (including driver and liquids) = 275kg\\n- Static Weight balance (including driver and liquids) = 45% front\\n- Car center of gravity height = 350mm\\n- Motion radios (= Wheel displacement / Spring displacement) = 1.1 front, 1.15 rear\\n- Tyre vertical stiffness = 80 N/mm (front and rear)\\n- Springs on the car during the autocross: Front = 42 N/mm, rear = 72 N/mm\\n- Springs at your disposal:\\nFront =  40, 42, 44, 46 N/mm\\nRear = 70, 72, 74, 76 N/mm",
