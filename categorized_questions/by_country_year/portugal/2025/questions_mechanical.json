The chocolate bar is then left to cool in a room with a constant temperature of 20°C. The manufacturer wants to determine the time it takes for the chocolate to cool down to a safe handling temperature of 30°C.\\n Given that the chocolate follows Newton's Law of Cooling, the manufacturer has conducted preliminary experiments and determined that the cooling rate constant (k) for this chocolate formulation is 0.02 per minute.\\n Determine the time it takes for the chocolate to cool down from 50°C to 30°C.\\n Answer in min and provide the value with 2 decimal places, e.g. 12.34.",
