    "text": "Last year’s car had a sprocket on the output shaft of the engine with 16 teeth. Connected to this sprocket was a chain that drove the output gear resulting in a gear ratio of 2.5. This year, the team wants to maintain the same sprocket but in the meanwhile the supplier has discontinued the previously used output gear and the closest one in stock has 2 extra teeth. What is the new gear ratio if the team chooses to use it?\\n Answer is unitless, provide the value with 1 decimal place, e.g. 12.3.",
