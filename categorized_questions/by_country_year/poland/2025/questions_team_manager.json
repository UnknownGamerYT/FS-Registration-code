For that pressure distribution needs to be obtained, at vehicle maximum speed, which is: 108 [km/h].\\nTo obtain it your team needs to run CFD simulation at that maximum velocity. To save some time, you must estimate height of first boundary layer - so that the y  value is not higher than 1 for this element. From previous simulation, run at 15 [m/s], you know that this value (first boundary layer height) was equal to YA.\\nFor the estimation purposes some simplifications were taken:\\n- Undertray has a shape of infinitely wide Venturi like tunnel, with dimensions (at 15 [m/s]) given in the drawing.\\n- The flow is undisturbed and no detachments occur.\\n- Velocity at the beginning of the undertray has the same velocity as simulation velocity.\\n- Dynamic viscosity, Density, Skin friction coefficient are the same for both simulations\\n\\nThe vehicle lowering under the aerodynamic load will be taken into account. Calculate this lowering and round it to integer, knowing that:\\n- Air density is equal to 1,225 [kg/m^3]\\n- Vehicle lift coefficient is equal to -1,95 [-]\\n- Reference surface is equal to 2,8 [m^2]\\n- Aerodynamic balance is 40:60\\n- Car and driver weight is 275 [kg], and mass distribution is 60% rear\\n- Stiffness of two front springs is 30 [N/mm], and two rear springs is 45 [N/mm]\\n- Motion ratio is equal to 1 [-]\\n- Ignore tire deflection\\n- Do not re-compute new downforce value after vehicle has been lowered\\n\\nEstimate maximum first layer height, return value as a constant [-] of known value YA (YB = x * YA).
