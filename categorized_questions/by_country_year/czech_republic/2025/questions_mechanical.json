    "text": "The material testing laboratory at your university is equipped with extremely precise measurement instruments but has very limited capacity. Your team worked hard to prepare all the laminate panels for SES testing. However, upon entering the laboratory, you realised you forgot to bring the baseline steel tube required by T3.2 to determine the test rig compliance. Fortunately, you spot what appears to be a piece of EN13674-1 50E2 steel Vignole rail lying in the corner, just long enough for use on your test rig with a 400 mm support span. With great effort, you place it on its flat bottom, and measure the following data:\\nF [N] dY [mm]\\n0 0.120210\\n5000 0.122638\\n10000 0.125065\\n15000 0.127493\\n20000 0.129920\\n25000 0.132348\\n30000 0.134776",
