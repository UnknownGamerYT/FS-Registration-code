    "text": "At your university there is a district heating network which is operated by a gas turbine. As an extension to your workshop is imminent, you want to know whether the output of the gas turbine is sufficient. How it works: In the gas turbine, air is compressed adiabatically and reversibly (1 → 2), then heated isobarically (2 → 3) and expanded adiabatically and reversibly (3 → 4). In the subsequent heat exchanger, isobaric cooling of the air from T4 to T5 causes a water mass flow of boiling liquid (6) to evaporate isobarically just completely (7). The flow diagram is shown in the following figure as well as further details.\\n Assumptions:\\n - Air can be regarded as an ideal gas.\\n - Water is a real substance.- It is a stationary flow process.\\n - All components are adiabatic to the outside.\\n - Differences in kinetic and potential energies can be neglected.\\n What is the efficiency of the gas turbine in percent (total of the components compressor, heat supply and expander)?\\n Round to two decimal places. Example: 12.34",
