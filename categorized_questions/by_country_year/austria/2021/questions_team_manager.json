During scrutineering you get told that a bonded connection is not allowed (T 2.6.10). In order to create the necessary mechanical connection you decide to add a shoulder bolt going through the necessary diameter of the shoulder bolt?\nConsider only one bolt and a required safety factor of 1.5 or higher. Allowed average contact pressure for the CFRP column is p_max=60MPa. Your steering column comes with an outer diameter of 25mm and an inner diameter of 20mm.
