Round solution to one decimal place.\nHow much percent increase the weight for this tube? [r=7.874 g/cm³] Round Solution to one decimal place.\nGive your answer in the following format: stiffness inc., weight inc. Example: if the stiffness increase is 45,6% and the weight increase is 23,4% then use 45.6, 23.4 as answer value.",
