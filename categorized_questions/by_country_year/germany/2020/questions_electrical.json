Assume the threshold voltages VHi and VLo to be properly set, and both the brake pressure sensor as wall as the tractive system current (P) / throttle position sensor (TPS) to have a positive slopw. The power-on-reset (PoR) signal is assumed to switch from low/false to high/true shortly after the power supply for the circuitry is turned on. If there is a high/true input signal to the MOSFET power stage, the MOSFET is in conducting mode. There is only one correct cirucut!",
