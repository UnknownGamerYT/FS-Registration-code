    "text": "Your team decides to use aluminum cables instead of copper to save weight. As there is no proper sizing table for these cables you try to calculate the proper fusing value yourself.\nThe cross-section of one cable is A.\nYou measured the thickness of the insulation which is t.\nFrom previous experiments you know, that the cables will face a maximum ambient temperature of Tamb inside your vehicle and that the heat transfer coefficient between the wire and ambient through the insulator is λ.\nThe coefficient is estimated in relation to the average diameter of the conductor and the conductor with insulator.\nWhich fuse value must be chosen to have the maximum possible current without exceeding a temperature of Tmax inside the cable. The fuses are available in 1 A size steps.\nThe fuse is considered to be ideal, i.e. it trips immeadiately if the rated current is exceeded.\nThe resistivity of aluminum is assumed to be ρAL\nThe linear approximation for temperature dependence with the temperature coefficient α is used.\nThe following conditions are assumed:\ncross section of cable A = 2 mm2\nthickness of insulation t = 0.36 mm\nmaximum ambient temperature Tamb = 50 °C\nmaximum wire temperature Tmax = 70 °C\nheat transfer coefficient between wire and insulator λ = 6 mW / (K * m)\nresistivity of aluminum ρAL=26.4 nΩm\ntemperature coefficient α=0.0041 1/K\n\nEnter the calculated fuse size.",
