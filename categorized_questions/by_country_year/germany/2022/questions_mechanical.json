    "text": "Your vehicle has its right-hand base coordinate frame defined with the x-axis pointing forward into driving direction and z-axis upwards. A camera is positioned in the vehicle with respect to the vehicle coordinate system as follows:\nx = 500 mm\ny = 160 mm\nZ = 1140 mm\nand the Euler angles ZY′X′′\nroll = 100°\npitch = 0°\nyaw = 90°\nAssume the camera has no distortion, a resolution of 1280 px x 1080 px and the principal point (cx and cy) and the focal lengths (fx and fy) are given by:\ncx = 636 px\ncy = 548 px\nfx = 241 px\nfy = 238 px\nThe point (u, v)0 is defined to be (u, v)0 = (-cx, -cy) as commonly used. Within the camera image plane (z axis in viewing direction), an object (center) is detected at pixel:\nu = 872 px\nv = 423 px\nAnother sensor determines the distance (euclidian) of the object with respect to camera frame:\nd = 1.9 m\nCalculate the position (3D) of the object with respect to the vehicle frame in meter! Round the solution to three decimal places. Give the solution in the following format: x, y, z, e.g. 1.234, 5.678, 9.012",
