The motor to wheel power delivery efficiency is 61% and the wheel diameter is 0.4m \\nThe aero drag coefficient is equal to Cd*A=1.5m^2, while the density of the air is considered equal to 1.2 kg/m^3. \\nThe friction losses from tires, bearings etc can be modeled with the following equation: Ffriction=1.4∗V^2, where V is vehicle speed in m/s \\nWhat is the maximum speed that can be reached by that vehicle?",

According to the datasheet of R2 the resistance is 92Ω for 50° Celsius and 108Ω at 60° Celsius with a 5% intolerance. What is the maximum voltage you are allowed to measure on Vout rounded to two decimal places without triggering an AMS error? You may use linear interpolation.",
