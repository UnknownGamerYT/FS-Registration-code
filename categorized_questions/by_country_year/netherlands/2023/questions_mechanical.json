Translating 0x5A into bits returns 0101 1010 and translating 0x2D into bits returns 0010 1101. \\n As can be seen both these translations of 0x5A and 0x2D match the pattern of the MOSI line. It is just how you would interpret the MOSI line. Interpretation of the MOSI line is done using the clock signal. \\n When you sample on the high clock edge the result is 0x2D whereas sampling on the low edge gives the value of 0x5A. It therefore seems, as the sampled returned value is not the one expected, that the sampling is done incorrectly and therefore C is the correct answer. As for sending the data, seeing that the signal on the MISO line is high until the deassert of the CS line, it is correctly sampled by the chip you are communicating to. \\n CS deassertion can always happen during command send and response receive.\\n The clock frequency is correct as the output traces of the MOSI line is showing the correct bits. Bits where not lost during transmission due to a too fast clock signal.",
