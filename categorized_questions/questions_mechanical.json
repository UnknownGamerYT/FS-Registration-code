Using the inertia of the tail, the cat tries to turn around the x-axis, see figure for definition, until the feet point downwards. How long does it take to turn? How long does the cat fall?\nThe cat is assumed to have a mass of 1.5kg. The tail has an rotational moment of inertia around the x-axis of 1.125gm2, the rest of the cat without the tail has an rotational moment of inertia around the x-axis of 4.8gm2. The tail has a maximum rotational angular speed of 2π rad/s around the x-axis. It is assumed, that the tail can be accelarated in no time. The aerodynamic drag coefficient is assumed to be cw = 0.8 independently of the orientation around the x-axis.

It is just how you would interpret the MOSI line. Interpretation of the MOSI line is done using the clock signal. \\n When you sample on the high clock edge the result is 0x2D whereas sampling on the low edge gives the value of 0x5A. It therefore seems, as the sampled returned value is not the one expected, that the sampling is done incorrectly and therefore C is the correct answer. As for sending the data, seeing that the signal on the MISO line is high until the deassert of the CS line, it is correctly sampled by the chip you are communicating to. \\n CS deassertion can always happen during command send and response receive.\\n The clock frequency is correct as the output traces of the MOSI line is showing the correct bits.

As an extension to your workshop is imminent, you want to know whether the output of the gas turbine is sufficient. How it works: In the gas turbine, air is compressed adiabatically and reversibly (1 → 2), then heated isobarically (2 → 3) and expanded adiabatically and reversibly (3 → 4). In the subsequent heat exchanger, isobaric cooling of the air from T4 to T5 causes a water mass flow of boiling liquid (6) to evaporate isobarically just completely (7). The flow diagram is shown in the following figure as well as further details.\\n Assumptions:\\n - Air can be regarded as an ideal gas.\\n - Water is a real substance.- It is a stationary flow process.\\n - All components are adiabatic to the outside.\\n - Differences in kinetic and potential energies can be neglected.\\n What is the efficiency of the gas turbine in percent (total of the components compressor, heat supply and expander)?\\n Round to two decimal places.
